## Start the prep early!

It is without a question that schools today care way more than just the student's GPA and test scores. However, scores do matter until you are considered "good enough". Take some time and get the satisfactory scores, early. So, the student can really shine in his/her hobbies and extracurriculars. 

# About High Mark Tutoring

I am experienced with teaching students how to learn. My tutoring sessions are not just answer sessions. I strive to help students identify their own weaknesses and build up good study habits. Tutoring sessions should only require an hour or two each week. I have a Bachelors and Masters degree from MIT, and the most important lesson from the institute is *learning how to learn*. I want to show students who want to improve *how* to get to where they want to be.

Because the SAT is **standardized**, I firmly believe that the SAT can be studied for. I can teach the student strategies for both preparation and test taking. Please see the [Services](/services/) page for details.

Lastly, I am a firm believer of quality over quantity. My hope is that for the SAT prepping, the student will not need my help for more than a few sessions. The sooner the student no longer needs me, the better. Do not pay me if the student is not satisfied with my first lesson. I want to spread good study habits and help those who want to be helped - I am not looking for many students, I just want to make a big impact on whom I do help.
