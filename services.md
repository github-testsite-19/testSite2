- General academic tutoring
- Advising

## Regarding SAT prep

For most students, there are no need for the SAT schools. Most of the improvement will have to come from practice exams anyways. My tutoring sessions are not just answer sessions. I strive to help students identify their own weaknesses and build up good study habits. Tutoring sessions should only require an hour or two each week, and should last no longer than a few weeks.

Clinics right before the SAT also seems to be in demand. These usually take place the weekend before the test and last about two hours, reviewing the student's weakness and offering answer selection strategies.

I charge $65 per hour, but price is always negotiable. First lesson is a trial - you do not have to pay me if the student is not satisfied. I am based in Cambrian, but I can travel to your location. Parents are welcome to sit in the first lesson.
