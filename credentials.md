# Past experience

I did not start learning English until age twelve. My first experience in standardized tests is a magnet high school placement test, in which I scored a whopping **thirteenth percentile** on the english section (this means... 87% of the student did better than me). Over the next few years, I had to sit down and figure out a way to improve my weak spots. Eventually, I was able to obtain a 780 on the SAT reading section. As long as the student grasps the way to study that is right for him/herself, results will come.

I have tutored and advised students in the past two and half years. The range of subjects range from SAT tutoring to college electronics. I served as a teaching assistant for several semesters and has a long experience in teaching students how to learn.
